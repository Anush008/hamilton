# Predicting due date using Hamilton

This is a fun example of a simple script in a jupyter notebook using Hamilton.

The goal is to predict the probability of delivery for an expecting mother, given:
1. The start date of the pregnancy
2. The current date

We want to answer the questions:
1. What is the probability that she will give birth on date X?
2. What is the probability that she will give birth before date X?

You can follow along in the [jupyter notebook](./notebook.ipynb) -- the entire dataflow is written/documented there.
